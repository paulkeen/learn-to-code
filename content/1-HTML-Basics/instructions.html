>> Elements

HTML (Hypertext Markup Language) uses tags in angle brackets that represent elements on a web page. Some elements can contain words and other elements in which case they have a start tag and an end tag which has an extra slash to show it's the end. Here are some common elements to try...

>>> Heading Level 1
```
<h1>Type your Heading</h1>
```

>>> Paragraphs
```
<p>This is a paragraph</p>
```

>>> Bold text
```
This is normal but <b>this is bold</b>.
```
NOTE: You can use this within other elements such as paragraphs.

>> A well structured page
