        <h1>Code for Real - JavasScript</h1>
        <p>The languages we have looked at so far are great for defining elements of a web page and styling those elements. HTML and CSS are referred to as Domain Specific Languages in that they are great at specific jobs. The next language we will look at is JavaScript which is the main programming language of the web and can be considered a General Purpose language and can be used to solve almost any computing requirement. 
            JavaScript is a very accessible programming language in the world because every browser on every device can understand it and it's fun and easy to use too.</p>
        <h2>Expressions</h2>
        <p>Using the HTML <code>script</code> element we can add JavaScript to our pages. By placing it as the last item in our body our JavaScript code will run after the browser loads the main parts of the page.</p>
        <p>In the example code <code>"Hello World"</code> is assigned to the <code>innerHTML</code> attribute of the <code>p</code> element using it's id as a reference. <code>document.getElementById</code> is a method that browsers provide to your JavaScript code for referencing elements on your page.</p>
        <p>We are going to use this setup to explore expressions which in this case is the code to on the right hand side of the <code>=</code></p>        
        <h3>Maths Expressions</h3>
        <p>You can replace the <code>"Hello World"</code> with <code>(4 + 7) / 2</code> and <code>Run the Code</code>. This is an expression just like in maths or what you might use in an Excel formula.</p>
        <table>
            <tr><td>Math Operation</td><td>Example</td></tr>
            <tr><td>Add</td><td>3 + 6</td></tr>
            <tr><td>Subtract</td><td>8 - 5</td></tr>
            <tr><td>Multiply</td><td>12 * 9</td></tr>
            <tr><td>Divide</td><td>10 / 2</td></tr>
            <tr><td>To the power of</td><td>4 ** 2</td></tr>
            <tr><td>Remainder from</td><td>11 % 2</td></tr>
            <tr><td>Brackets</td><td>((4 + 7) + 100 / 5) * 3</td></tr>
            <tr><td>Square Root</td><td>Math.abs(-5)</td></tr>
            <tr><td>Absolute Value</td><td>Math.sqrt(16)</td></tr>
            <tr><td><i>etc...</i></td><td><i>See: <a target="_blank" href="https://www.w3schools.com/js/js_math.asp">www.w3schools.com/js/js_math</a></i></td></tr>
        </table>
        <h3>String Expressions</h3>
        <p>Strings are text values and, like the <code>"Hello World"</code> example, they are usually defined by putting quotes around words. Text in quotes is not treated like code but more like a data value.</p>
        <p>JavaScipt has a easy way to construct strings from other expressions using the back-tick character <code>`</code> usually found in the very top left of your keyboard.</p>
        <p>Try this expression where the Hello World was...</p>
        <code>`You are about ${21 * 365} days old.`</code>
        <p>The <code>${...}</code> notation is computed as a separate expression and then inserted into the sentence.</p>
        <p>There are many other ways to manipulate strings. For more information see: <a target="_blank" href="https://www.w3schools.com/js/js_strings.asp">www.w3schools.com/js/js_strings</a></p>
        <h3>Boolean Expressions</h3>
        <p>If you need your code to do different things depending on some input or parameter then we need to have a way of expressing logic. Logic operators results in a value that is <code>true</code> or <code>false</code>.</p>
        <p>Try changing the expression after the equals again to <code>4 &lt; 9</code>.</p>
        <p>In this case the less than operator checks if 4 is less than 9 and returns a value of <code>true</code>. Other Boolean operations include:</p>
        <table>
            <tr><td>Boolean Operation</td><td>Example</td></tr>
            <tr><td>Equals</td><td>5 == 3 + 2</td></tr>
            <tr><td>Less Than</td><td>3 &lt; 6</td></tr>
            <tr><td>Greater Than</td><td>8 &gt; 5</td></tr>
            <tr><td>Less Than or Equal To</td><td>8 &lt;= 5</td></tr>
            <tr><td>Greater Than or Equal To</td><td>5 &gt;= 5</td></tr>
            <tr><td>Not (opposite)</td><td>!true</td></tr>
            <tr><td>And (both conditions need to be true)</td><td>3 &lt; 7 && 5 == 3 + 2</td></tr>
            <tr><td>Or (either condition need to be true)</td><td>3 &lt; 7 && 5 == 7</td></tr>
        </table>
        <h2>Variables</h2>
        <p>Rather than just putting information on the page we can store results of expressions in memory so our page or app can use them later. We are already doing this for our result value which is stored in memory and then referenced in the <code>//Show result</code> section of code to display it on our web page. 
            We can asign values to a name by using the <code>let</code> key word followed by the name to use and an expression. These named reference are commonly called variables because while their reference name is consistant the value they hold can be changed.</p>
        <p>Try replacing the <code>Evaluate expression</code> section of code with the following:</p>
        <pre><code>
let a = 4
let b = 8
a = 12
let result = a * b
        </code></pre>
        <p>This defines <code>a</code> and sets it's value to 4, then defines <code>b</code> and sets it's value to 8. After that <code>a</code> is updated to now be 12 and then finally we use those variable names in our expression just like we would with normal values.</p>
        <h3>Data Types</h3>
        <p>At this point we should look at data types. Up to now we have been working with strings, numbers and Booleans but JavaScript supports other data types such as <code>arrays</code> (which are ordered lists of things) and more complex <code>objects</code> which we will look at in a later lesson.</p>
        <p>To specify an array/list we can use square brackets to both define a list as well as get an item from the list by it's index number (position in the list):</p>
        <pre><code>
let people = ["Tim", "Karen", "Simon", "Linda"]
let result = people[2]
        </code></pre>
        <p>You may have expected to see "Karen" as the result but indexes in JavaScript, and most other languages, start with zero for the first item, 1 for the second, etc..</p>
        <h2>Conditions</h2>
        <p>Conditions let you branch your code into to blocks where one gets used if the condition is true and the other one gets used if it's false. The basic <code>if...else</code> for example required a Boolean Expression (see above) and then has two blocks of code as follows:</p>
        <pre><code>
let index = 0
let result = ""
let people = ["Tim", "Karen", "Simon", "Linda"]
if (people[index] == "Tim") {
    result = "Hi Timbo. You are a special case."
} else {
    result = `Hello ${people[index]}`
}
        </code></pre>
        <p>As you change the index variable you can see how the result is affected.</p>
        <h2>Functions</h2>
        <p>Functions in code are much like a function in maths, they take parameters and usually produce a result. There are many built-in functions available such as the Math functions we saw earlier an where functions are grouped together like that it's called a library or a library of functions.</p>
        <p>It's easy to define your own functions by using the <code>function</code> keyword. Here is an example:</p>
        <pre><code>
function greeting(name) {
    return `Hello ${name}`
}

let index = 3
let people = ["Tim", "Karen", "Simon", "Linda"]
let result = greeting(people[index])
        </code></pre>
        <p>The function definition consists of a name 'greeting' followed by brackets with the names of the parameters it is expecting to get when called. The body of the function is a code block in <code>{...}</code> curly brackets that is executed when the function is used. Functions have a special key word <code>return</code> that is used to sent the result back to the part of your code that made use of the function.</p>
        <p>The last line here uses the name from the list and then calls the <code>greeting</code> function to turn it into a message.</p>
        <h2>Loops</h2>
        <p>Computers are great at repeating tasks using loops. Looping over the items in a list is easy using the <code>map</code> method of a list. The <code>map</code> method takes a function as a parameter and applies it to each item in the list. The output is a new list containing each value generated from the supplied function.</p>
        <pre><code>
function initials(name) {
    //Extract the first character from the name
    return name.substring(0, 1)
}

let people = ["Tim", "Karen", "Simon", "Linda"]
let result = people.map(initials)
        </code></pre>
        <p>As with other patterns of coding there are other ways of looping over areas of your code. See: <a target="_blank" href="https://www.w3schools.com/js/js_loop_for.asp">www.w3schools.com/js/js_loop_for</a></p>
        <h2>Inline Functions (Closures)</h2>
        <p>An function can be inserted into an expression rather than being defined with a name. These are also called anonymous functions (as they have no name) or closures and are very useful.</p>
        <p>Here is the same result as the last example but using an in-line function rather than a named function:</p>
        <pre><code>
let people = ["Tim", "Karen", "Simon", "Linda"]
let result = people.map(function (person) {
    return person.substring(0, 1)
})
        </code></pre>
        <p>JavaScript has some short hand for defining a function that doesn't need us to use the code <code>function</code> any more. This is done by specifying the parameters to the function followed by <code>=&gt;</code> and then the expression to apply.</p>
        <p>Also where there is only one parameter we don't need the brackets around the parameters. And if we code in an expression without a code block we don't need the special return key-word either. So the solution simplifies down to:</p>
        <pre><code>
let people = ["Tim", "Karen", "Simon", "Linda"]
let result = people.map(person => person.substring(0, 1))
        </code></pre>
        <p>Nice!</p>

                let pos = localStorage.getItem(`scrollPos-${window.location.pathname}`)
                document.documentElement.scrollTop = pos
                window.addEventListener("scroll", (e) => {
                    localStorage.setItem(`scrollPos-${window.location.pathname}`, document.documentElement.scrollTop)
                })
        </script>
