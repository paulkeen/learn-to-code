        <p>Quotation: <q>The cat or domestic cat is a small carnivorous mammal. 
            It is the only domesticated species in the family Felidae. 
            The cat is either a house cat, kept as a pet, or a feral cat, 
            freely ranging and avoiding human contact. A house cat is 
            valued by humans for companionship and for its ability to 
            hunt rodents.</q> <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cat">Wikipedia</a></p>
